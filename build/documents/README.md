# Vectorium Documents

This folder is served publicly by the site at `/documents/*`.

## Canonical files (used by the UI)
The landing page expects these exact filenames:
- `whitepaper.pdf`
- `technical-paper.pdf`
- `private-sale.pdf`
- `term-sheet.pdf`

If you replace documents, keep the filenames the same to avoid breaking links.
